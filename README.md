### 1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
   getElementById is used to grab a single element by its unique id. It always returns either that element or null if nothing matches. In contrast, getElementsByClassName fetches all elements that share a specific class name and gives back a live HTMLCollection which means it automatically reflects any changes in the DOM. Meanwhile, querySelector and querySelectorAll are more versatile since they accept any valid CSS selector. querySelector stops at the first matching element, while querySelectorAll returns a static NodeList containing all matches (it won’t update when the DOM changes).

### 2. How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?
   To add a new element to the DOM you start with document.createElement(), which generates the element. After creating it, you can define its content or attributes and then insert it into the desired part of the document. For example, if you want to add a new paragraph, you would create it using document.createElement("p"), set its text with the textContent property, and then place it inside a parent element using methods like appendChild(), append(), prepend() or insertBefore(). Using appendChild() will add the element to the end of the parent, prepend() will insert it at the beginning and insertBefore() lets you place it before a specific existing child. This process ensures that elements can be created dynamically and positioned exactly where they are needed within the DOM structure.

### 3. What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?
   Event bubbling is the process where an event triggered on a child element travels upward through its ancestors in the DOM tree until it reaches the root (document). For example, if you click a button inside a <div> the click event first fires on the button, then bubbles up to the <div>, then to the <body>, and finally to the document. This behavior allows parent elements to handle events that occur on their children without needing to attach individual listeners to each child.By default, most JavaScript events bubble, but developers can control this behavior. Using event.stopPropagation() prevents an event from moving any further up the hierarchy, while event capturing (the opposite phase) allows handling an event before it reaches its target. Overall, this mechanism makes event handling more efficient and flexible when working with complex DOM structures.

### 4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
   Event delegation in JavaScript is a technique where, instead of attaching separate event listeners to multiple child elements, a single event listener is added to their common parent. Thanks to event bubbling, when an event occurs on a child element it propagates up to the parent where the parent’s event listener can detect the actual source using event.target. This approach enhances performance by reducing the number of event listeners in the DOM, keeps the code cleaner and is especially useful for dynamically created elements since new children don’t require additional listeners.

### 5. What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?
   The preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods in JavaScript are often used together but serve different purposes. The preventDefault() method stops the browser’s built-in behavior for an event—for example, preventing a form from submitting, stopping a link from redirecting, or disabling the right-click context menu. In contrast, stopPropagation() prevents the event from bubbling up through the DOM, ensuring that only the target element’s event handler executes. In short, preventDefault() controls the browser’s default action while stopPropagation() controls how the event flows through the DOM hierarchy.
